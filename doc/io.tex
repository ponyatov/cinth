\secrel{IO}

IO-inherited frames represent generated source code resides in a disk file
structure. It is not required to write real files on a code generation run, they
can be browsed in a viewer window, or printed on the console to be manually
checked and copied in place.

\pylst{io}

As an example, here we already are able to describe the generic project
\ref{project}\ structure, by building a predefined set of files with its
contents written in the bare source code strings.

\pylst{hello_files}
