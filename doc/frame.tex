The data (and knowledge) representation model was inherited from Marvin Minsky's
ideas about the method of generic knowledge representation and reasoning in
AI-related applications. It was extended by an ability to store ordered data
elements, which is critically required in programming language design and
applications. In result, we can represent such as things like attribute grammars
and AST, any source code, files and directory structure, and relations between
programming objects (both at a domain model and source code level).
