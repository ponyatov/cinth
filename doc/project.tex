\pylst{project}

Project holds all the data frame grid related to a concrete single project you
are working on. Multiple projects in you cinth workbench designed to share most
objects represent code templates, relations between domain model elements, etc.

That's the power of generative metaprogramming: you can have hundreds of
projects for multiple clients, hold distinctions individually in every project,
but in the same time share all your implementation ideas and code snippets over
the whole working set.
