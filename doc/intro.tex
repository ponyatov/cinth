Embedded \emc\ language\note{C and a very limited \cpp} is too low-level but
required for embedded programming, and its use is forced by company policy. You
know about Rust language are promoted as a replacement of C++ for embedded
programming, but you can't use it as the only ANSI C is legal in your company
and working team. And you can't avoid this requirement, but also in some cases
you'll be faced that C++ is also prohibited for use with very little MCU-based
devices or legacy code.

These notes provide some solution and approach to making software development in
any programming language and toolchain using Python. It can be formulated as:
